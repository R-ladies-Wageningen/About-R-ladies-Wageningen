# About-R-ladies-Wageningen

As a diversity initiative, the mission of R-Ladies is to achieve proportionate representation by encouraging, inspiring, and empowering people of genders currently underrepresented in the R community. R-Ladiesâ€™ primary focus, therefore, is on supporting minority gender R enthusiasts to achieve their programming potential, by building a collaborative global network of R leaders, mentors, learners, and developers to facilitate individual and collective progress worldwide. On Tuesday 4.9.2018 the R-Ladies Wageningen had its first official meeting at NIOO. Almost twenty women attended so it confirmed that there is a need for this kind of group also in Wageningen. We had lots of excellent ideas for future meetings and workshops and we will start with one day R-introductory workshop. We will also collaborate with R-Users group at the Wageningen University.
